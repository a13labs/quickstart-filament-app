# Template for a empty C++ application wth google filament

This is a simple quickstart for developing a C++ application with Filament render engine

## Note

Currently filament is being fetched from a custom repo, the reason is that the main repo of filament is still working in clang 8 which causes issues on using more recent versions of clang found in more recent distribuitions (ie: Ubuntu 22.04, Fedora 37).
